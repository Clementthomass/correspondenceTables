\usage{
classificationEndpoint(endpoint = "ALL")
}
\arguments{
\item{endpoint}{SPARQL endpoints provide a standardized way to access data sets, 
making it easier to retrieve specific information or perform complex queries on linked data. This is an optional
parameter, which by default is set to \code{"ALL"}.
The valid values are \code{"CELLAR"}, \code{"FAO"} and \code{"ALL"} for both endpoints.}
}
\value{
\code{classificationEndpoint()} returns a table with information needed to retrieve the classification table:
\itemize{
    \item Prefix name: the  SPARQL instruction for a declaration of a namespace prefix
    \item Conceptscheme: taxonomy of the SKOS object to be retrieved
    \item URI: the URL from which the SPARQL query was retrieved
    \item Name: the name of the table retrieved
}
}
\description{
The purpose of this function is to provide a comprehensive summary 
of the data structure for each classification in CELLAR and FAO endpoint. 
The summary includes information such as the prefix name, URI, key, concept scheme, and title associated with each classification.
